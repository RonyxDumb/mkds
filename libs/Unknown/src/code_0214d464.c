#include "code_0214d464.h"

// Resumable form of the expansion in func_0214d344. a points at the saved state: the output pointer at 0, the number
// of bytes still to write at 4, the current flag byte at 0xb, the flag bits left at 0xc, the back copy length at 0xd
// and a pending-byte flag at 0xe. Reads at most c bytes from b, writes every output byte with swpb, stores the state
// back and returns the number of bytes still to write.
// Not compiled code: it uses swpb, tst and a flag-setting add of an asr operand, which the 1.2 compiler never builds.
