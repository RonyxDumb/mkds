# Mario Kart DS decompilation

A matching decompilation of *Mario Kart DS* for the Nintendo DS. The C in this repository is written with AI
assistance so that, built with the original compiler, it reproduces the game's code byte for byte.

**No game content is included.** The repository holds no ROM, no assets and no disassembly. To build, you need your
own dump of the game; see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

| Version | Game code | SHA-1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| USA | `AMCE` | `691e00d9a5dd80b04f80cc7559503e8b06848785` |
| Europe | `AMCP` | `ce97d9b43f0d3ca0d48b781983e8a16f6393378f` |

Every function is decompiled from the game's own code. Code from other decompilations is not accepted.

## Progress
Each version's section is recorded from a build of that version (`python3 tools/configure.py <ver>`):
`ninja report && python3 tools/progress.py update`.
